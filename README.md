# coding-round

NodeJS(v6.10.0) and npm(3.10.10) has been used to solve the challenges.

### Dependencies installation
`npm install`

## Execution guide

Question 1 solution: `node .\Question-1\solution.js` or `cd Question-1; node solution.js`

Question 2 solution: `node .\Question-2\solution.js` or `cd Question-2; node solution.js`

## Test suite Execution guide
`npm test`

## Questions
*1.* - Write a program that will print three elements in an array whose sum is 
equal to a given number.

*2.* - I have some friends records in a text file (friends.json) -- one friend 
per line, JSON-encoded. I want to invite any friends within 100km of our 
Bangalore office which is almost like our home (GPS coordinates 
12.9611159,77.6362214) for some food and drinks on us. Write a program that 
will read the full list of friends and output the names and user ids of 
matching friends (within 100km), sorted by user id (ascending).

The solutions are being disclosed only to show my ability to write good code. There are test suites, edge cases, modularity, etc in the solutions.
